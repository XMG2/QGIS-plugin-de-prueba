# QGIS-plugin-de-prueba
This is a test of how QGIS plugins work

Is my first plugin dont judge it

The funcionalities that the plugin will have are bullshit

There are two funcionalities:

1- A button that opens in the browser a tab with the API documentation

2- Another button and a plugin menu option that saves the attributes values
of a layer in a CSV file
